Major cloud providers offer free tiers for specific resources within their product catalogs, as a tactic to attract new users to their platforms. However, these services are normally not well documented nor their information is aggregated to allow the user to focus on deploying only the free resources - the financial interest is to learn the whole platform as you deploy these free resources.

This project aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical solutions for anyone that wants to learn these platforms with practical examples, or just wants these free resources without the hassle of learning everything else.

```bash copy
terraform init \
&& terraform apply -auto-approve
```

To visualize the repository available commands:

```bash
# Installs go-task
sudo sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b /usr/local/bin

 # Display help message
task --list
```
---

Now if you want to explicitly call the core module, write a `main.tf` with this content:

```hcl copy {6,12,17,19} filename="main.tf"
// Create a main.tf file anywhere with Terraform installed and copy-paste this code

module "tf-free" {
   source = "github.com/gruberdev/tf-free"

   enable_aws         = true  
   aws_account_id     = "your-aws-access-id"
   aws_account_key    = "your-aws-secret-key"
   aws_default_region = "us-west1"

  enable_gcp         =  true
  gcp_project_id     = "testing-project-1"
  gcp_project_region = "us-west-1"
  gcp_instance_name  = "gcp-machine"

  enable_azure   =  true

  enable_oracle   =  true
}
```

If you're unsure what your credentials are for each cloud provider, take a look at [Obtaining credentials](/docs/setup/first-run).
