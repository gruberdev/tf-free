> **Creating all available resources offered by major cloud providers within free-tier plans, using Terraform to provide, manage and access these resources in a simplified and centralized manner.**

Every major cloud provider offers a free tier that allows for some kind of resource free of charge, still, learning every cloud and managing these resources can prove burdensome to most.

The goal is to automate the management of these resources using Terraform as the centralizing tool. It also aims to provide resources for learning and improve your skills as a SRE/DevOps Engineer and as a Terraform user, even if you're developer that never touched cloud infrastructure, nowadays there's great value in learning these tools.

```bash copy
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

To visualize the available commands:

```bash
sudo sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b /usr/local/bin
task --list # Display help message
```
---

Now, if you want to explicitly call the core module, write a `main.tf` with this content:

```hcl copy {6,12,17,19} filename="main.tf"
// Create a main.tf file anywhere with Terraform installed and copy-paste this code

module "tf-free" {
   source = "github.com/gruberdev/tf-free"

   enable_aws          = true  
   enable_s3_backend  = true 
   aws_account_id     = "your-aws-access-id"
   aws_account_key    = "your-aws-secret-key"
   aws_default_region = "us-west1"

  enable_gcp   =  true
  gcp_project_id     = "testing-project-1"
  gcp_project_region = "us-west-1"
  gcp_instance_name  = "gcp-machine"

  enable_azure   =  true

  enable_oracle   =  true
}
```

If you're unsure what your credentials are for each cloud provider, take a look at [Obtaining credentials](/docs/setup/first-run).
