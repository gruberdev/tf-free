# tf-free

<a href='https://drone.gruber.dev.br/gruberdev/tf-free' target='_blank'>![drone-img]</a>

## Objective

> **Creating and managing all available resources offered by major cloud providers in free-tier plans. Terraform is as the main tool used for creating, managing and providing access to these resources in a simplified and centralized manner.**

## Motivation

Every major cloud provider offers a free tier that allows for the creation of all kind of resources free of charge, still, learning every cloud and managing these resources could prove burdensome.

The goal of this repository is to automate the management of these resources using Terraform as the central tool. It also aims to provide resources for learning and improve your skills as a DevOps Engineer and as a Terraform user. A CLI tool is part of this project for those who want a KIS approach.

## Getting started

```
curl -s https://free.terraform.gruber.dev.br/setup.sh | bash
