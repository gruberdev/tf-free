	Use:   "destroy",
	Short: "Destroy resources, can be specificed per cloud provider basis",
	Long: `A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains examples
and usage of using your command. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// destroyCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	destroyCmd.Flags().BoolP("all", "a", false, "Destroy all previously created resources")
	destroyCmd.Flags().BoolP("provider", "p", false, "Specify the cloud provider. Options: [aws, az, gcp]")
	destroyCmd.Flags().BoolP("dry-run", "d", false, "Creates a terraform plan, but for destroying resources")
}
